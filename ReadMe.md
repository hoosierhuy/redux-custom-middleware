An example of custom redux middleware for myself or anyone else to use as a reference, especially if you jump back and forth between stacks, tasks, frameworks, technologies, etc.  

On a side note, I'm using native promises and axios to work with restful api, I know there are new fandango libraries out there to do similar work, but look at their size, and with Redux already a pub/sub system, do you really need RxJS????  Not all of us works for NetFlix.

There's no unit testing in this repo, I've already demonstrated unit testing for react/redux in my other repos
